This repository contains stuff one can find useful while solving competitive programming problems.

I collected some pre-written codes for commonly used algorithms and techniques.
I tried to make my codes as good as possible, so people can easily read them and configure for their particular needs.

Repository will be regularly updated with new things I will find useful and suitable.
